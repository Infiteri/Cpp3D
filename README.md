# CORE ENGINE

Small engine made so I can learn some more about C++.

## BUILD

Its built with "make" and MSYS2 UCRT64 Toolchain (not that it matters as long as g++ is present)
Requirements:
    - C++ Compiler (g++)
    - Make
    - win32

## VENDOR
Used libraries:
    GLAD
	ImGui
    GLFW

Stiil in work as not even shader assets are present YET
